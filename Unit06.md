**Unit 6: The New Avant-Garde After Abstract Expressionism: Neo-Dada,
Pop Art and Minimalism** <span id="6"></span> 
In this unit, you will study art movements of the 1950s and 1960s and
observe the ways in which artists began to incorporate “non-art” media
such as pop culture imagery, found objects, and industrial materials
into their art. You will also examine the trends in popular art that led
to the emergence of Neo-Dada, Pop Art, and Minimalism and you will learn
why artists largely abandoned abstraction to focus their efforts on new
forms of realism.

    describe the defining characteristics of each.
-   Identify key works of art by the significant artists from the 1950s
    and 1960s and explain why each fits into their particular movement.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Rauschenberg’s most
    significant achievementconsists of his invention of a type of
    assemblage called the “Combine.” Read carefully, noting any
    references to Rauschenberg’s collage work, assemblage, and
    particularly his Combines, as well as the key characteristics of
    these works. How does the Combine differ from traditional painting
    and sculpture? From your reading, consider why the Combine is such a
    major contribution to modern art.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Much of Johns’s most
    celebrated work consists of the portrayal of familiar, everyday
    objects in a non-representational manner. What are features of
    Johns’s art that qualify it as part of the Neo-Dada movement?

-   **Reading: The Art Story Foundation’s Movements: “Pop Art”**
    Link: The Art Story Foundation’s Movements: [“Pop

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. While reading this
    page, look carefully for references to how Pop Art—one of the 20th
    century’s most important and distinctive movements—got its name.
    After identifying the movement’s definition and the root of its
    name, consider why the work of Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and
    others is categorized as such. Identify the different types of Pop
    Art, citing specific examples of each type and making note of their
    key differences and underlying similarities.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Andy Warhol is perhaps
    the most celebrated and revered American artist in history. In
    general, what is it about his work and life that might contribute to
    the widespread and continuing fascination with Warhol? You will note
    in your reading that while Warhol was not personally or artistically
    opposed to abstraction, his particular brand of Pop Art is
    considered a departure from or direct challenge to Abstract
    Expressionism, Pop’s dominant preceding movement. Once you are
    familiar with both Pop Art and Abstract Expressionism, cite specific
    elements in Warhol’s work that make it both distinctly modern and
    the opposite of Abstract Expressionism. Alternatively, if you
    believe this assessment to be false, cite your reasons for doing
    so.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Lichtenstein’s
    depiction of popular culture imagery, particularly comic book
    iconography, is well known in the history of modern art. What is not
    as well known is Lichtenstein’s method; what are some of the key
    characteristics of Lichtenstein’s painting method(s)? What
    similarities can be drawn between Lichtenstein’s art and that of the
    19th-century Post-Impressionist artist Georges Seurat?

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. While reading this
    page, make careful note of the individual artists associated with
    Minimalism. You will also note from your reading that this movement
    originally went by several different names, such as “ABC Art” and
    “Reductive Art,” yet “Minimalism” is the name that has endured.
    Articulate the reasoning behind this moniker. Finally, look
    carefully at the Major Works section and cite specific
    characteristics of certain works that fit the definition of the
    term.

    Judd”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ARTH208-6.3.2-Donald-Judd.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Despite the seemingly
    exacting and precise appearance of Judd’s Minimalist work, the
    artist denied any affinity for mathematics and instead characterized
    his work as the result of an intuitive process that played with
    space, natural light, unity, and an object’s existence. From this
    rather general explanation, attempt to identity Judd’s intentions
    with his work. Additionally, Judd made a discovery later in his
    career that allowed his “intuitive process” to reach new heights.
    Describe this discovery and, if you choose, take notes on how his
    work changed and evolved over the course of his career.

    Stella”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ARTH208-6.3.3-Frank-Stella.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Frank Stella is well
    known for challenging accepted conventions in modern art, namely,
    the notion that a canvas must be rectangular or square, and that
    abstract art, for the most part, should consist of gestural
    brushstrokes. Instead, Stella applied geometric elements in his work
    and often created irregularly shaped canvases. Cite specific
    examples of artworks that fit these descriptions, using passages
    from Stella’s biography and examples of Major Works.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Pay close attention to
    passages that reference Andre’s unique contributions to Minimalism.
    Cite examples of the materials and imagery Andre appropriated, and
    how he constructed and combined these elements in his art. How was
    his art different from that of other key Minimalists like Judd,
    Stella, and Dan Flavin? As an option, you may wish to read Barry
    Schwabsky’s article in ArtForum, “Carl Andre—Paula Cooper Gallery,
    New York, New York” for added context.
