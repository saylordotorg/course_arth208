**Unit 1: A New Perspective in Art: Impressionism** <span
id="1"></span> 
In this unit, you will begin by learning about the visual arts that were
popular in mid-19th-century France and the role that the Academy of Art
played in the eventual emergence of the first modern art movement,
Impressionism. Along with Impressionism, you will study the movement
that immediately preceded it, Realism, analyze important artworks by key
artists in both movements, and learn what was accomplished via new or
rediscovered methods and ideas, such as the newfound embrace of plein
air painting; the use of quick, gestural brushstrokes; and the
abandonment of traditional one-point perspective.

    wish to take notes on the artistic genres and subject matter that
    were favored by the Academy and its exhibitions. Meanwhile, look for
    examples of what artists began to rebel against in the

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full, while paying
    particularly close attention to each of the Major Works and the
    accompanying texts. In this reading, you will note that Courbet’s
    paintings fall into the category of Realism. With this in mind,
    consider how Courbet’s subject matter differs from that of
    Renaissance artists like Michelangelo or Titian, how his approach to
    this subject matter reflected his commitment to left-wing politics,
    and how his work helped pave the way for Impressionism.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. While reading, consider
    Degas’s chosen subject matter (people, places, settings) and try to
    identify visual elements that suggest the artist’s gradual evolution
    in both subject and style. You may wish to take notes while viewing
    the artist’s Major Works. What makes Degas both a Realist and
    Impressionist artist?

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Pay close attention to
    the repeated use of the word “modern” in this page, and consider

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. You will note from this
    reading that Monet was both an accomplished colorist and a master of
    plein air(open air) painting; he is also considered the preeminent
    Impressionist artist. However, many critics at the time accused
    Monet’s work of being “incomplete.” Why would such a claim be
    made?
