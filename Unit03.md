**Unit 3: Freedom in Pre-War Europe: Fauvism, Futurism, Expressionism
and Cubism** <span id="3"></span> 
In this unit, you will learn about the most important European art
movements prior to the outbreak of World War I and how each one
challenged society’s understanding of the category of “art.” You will
also read and learn about how the idea of the modern man greatly
informed movements of this era, including Fauvism, Futurism,
Expressionism, and the most recognizable modern style of the early 20th
century, Cubism. Most importantly, you will explore how political
ideology and philosophical currents influenced artists and their work,
and you will learn how this trend added a new dimension to the
development of modern art.

Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Define the movements known as Fauvism, Futurism, Expressionism, and
    Cubism.
-   Identify the visual elements that set Fauvism, Futurism,
    Expressionism, and Cubism apart from preceding modern movements.
-   Explain the many ways by which political and philosophical ideas
    were expressed through visual art, and discuss why artists and works
    from this time period are so significant to the development of
    modern art.

**3.1 The Fauves: Pure Color** <span id="3.1"></span> 
**3.1.1 Fauvism** <span id="3.1.1"></span>

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Compared to earlier
    movements, Fauvism represented both a progressive leap forward in
    painterly style and a conservative regression to traditional motifs.
    Read this page carefully for examples of this, and consider what
    made Fauvism different from previous modern movements and, at the
    same time, in-tune with avant-garde trends. Additionally, look for
    references to earlier artists and movements that informed the
    Fauvist style, and cite specific examples. If you like, go back to
    previous artist and movement pages in order to compare and contrast
    preceding artworks with those of the Fauves.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. While reading, you will
    notice several references to Matisse’s use of color. Read carefully,
    and take note of how the artist’s use of color is described (“pure,”
    “bright,” etc.). Consider what is significant about Matisse’s work,
    and what characterizes it as “modern.”

    [“Cubism”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ARTH208-3.2.1-Cubism.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. While reading about the
    Cubist movement, consider why the term “Cubism” was applied to the
    work of Picasso, Georges Braque, and others. One could argue that
    there are several different styles of Cubism, but that at its core,
    all Cubists experimented with a compositional grid wherein various
    forms are layered. Read carefully about the different Cubists,
    identify the definitions of “analytic” vs. “synthetic” Cubism as
    well as the visual characteristics of Cubism as a whole, and think
    about what makes the movement so important to modern art.

**3.2.2 Pablo Picasso** <span id="3.2.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Art Story Foundation’s Artists: “Pablo Picasso”**
    Link: The Art Story Foundation’s Artists: [“Pablo
    Picasso”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ARTH208-3.2.2-Pablo-Picasso.pdf) 
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. In the modern canon,
    Pablo Picasso is widely considered to be thedefinitive modern
    artist, and the standard to which all other modern artists are held.
    Part of the reason for this is Picasso’s prolific artistic output,
    as well as the fact that he worked in so many different styles
    throughout his long life. The artistic movement to which he’s most
    often linked is Cubism, which he co-founded with Georges Braque.  
        
     Read this page’s content carefully and identify some of the
    different visual styles (and movements) that Picasso adopted and
    mastered in his career, all the while paying particularly close
    attention to his Cubist works, theories, and practices. In addition
    to his role in the invention of the style, consider why Picasso is
    so important to any discussion of Cubism. Additionally, look at his
    Major Works and try to place each work into its corresponding
    movement or style. Note that in some cases, works may fit into more
    than one category.

**3.2.3 Georges Braque** <span id="3.2.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Art Story Foundation’s Artists: “Georges Braque”**
    Link: The Art Story Foundation’s Artists: [“Georges
    Braque”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ARTH208-3.2.3-Georges-Braque.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Braque is one of the
    more underrated modern artists; his name is rarely mentioned without
    being coupled with that of his fellow Cubist, Picasso. However,
    Braque’s Cubism is more analytic, compared with Picasso’s synthetic
    approach. Read this page carefully and look at his Major Works.
    After doing so, think about why such a claim has been made and
    identify some of the characteristics of Braque’s work. If needed,
    re-familiarize yourself with the definitions for “analytic” and
    “synthetic” Cubism.

    Léger”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ARTH208-3.2.4-Fernand-Leger.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Léger’s unique brand of
    Cubism has alternatively been labeled “Tubism.” How are Cubism and
    Tubism similar and dissimilar? Read this page closely for a
    reference to this term, consider how such a title came about, and,
    finally, look at Léger’s Major Works to try to identify visual
    characteristics that may fit the definition of Tubism. How did Léger
    extend the practice of Cubism and what was his achievement?

**3.3 The Futurists: “The Beauty of Speed”** <span id="3.3"></span> 
**3.3.1 Futurism** <span id="3.3.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Art Story Foundation’s Movements: “Futurism”**

    [“Futurism”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ARTH208-3.3.1-Futurism.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Futurism was arguably
    the first modern art movement to adopt a formal manifesto. While
    reading, pay close attention to any references to Filippo Tommaso
    Marinetti, the author of the Futurist Manifesto, and, if you so
    choose, take notes on Marinetti’s philosophy. Consider as an
    OPTIONAL READING the “Founding and Manifesto of Futurism,”and pay
    close attention to its central tenets. From this, think about what
    the Futurist artists were attempting to achieve and communicate
    through their art. Also, while looking at the Major Works on this
    page, consider how Cubism informed the Futurists and their work, and
    cite specific examples of this where possible.

**3.3.2 Umberto Boccioni** <span id="3.3.2"></span>

    Boccioni”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ARTH208-3.3.2-Umberto-Boccioni.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Aside from Marinetti,
    Umberto Boccioni was the most celebrated of all the Futurists, for
    both his work and academic background. His early death during World
    War I made him emblematic of the Futurists’ celebration of the
    machine and the violent, destructive forces of modernity. While
    reading, look closely for references to Boccioni that set him and
    his work apart from that of his fellow Futurists, and for
    explanations as to why his art is exemplary of the movement.
    Finally, think about why Boccioni’s work warrants special
    attention.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. While reading, look
    closely for references to how, and particularly, why, the
    Expressionist movement got its name. Of the artists have you already
    studied in this course, who was most important to the Expressionist
    style?  Additionally, consider that Expressionism was a movement
    centered in Germany. With this in mind, think about the social
    circumstances in which the movement emerged and developed, the
    individual artists associated with it, and, most importantly, why
    Expressionism could not have thrived in Germany after the 1920s.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Kirchner was one of the
    most influential Expressionist artists and one of the founders of
    the artist group Die Brüke (The Bridge). Look closely for any
    references to this group and take notes on some of the specifics of
    Kirchner’s goals through the formation of the group. Additionally,
    pay close attention to Kirchner’s Major Works and note in particular
    how he approached the human figure and form. What visual
    characteristics can you identify that make Kirchner’s approach
    unique?

    Kandinsky”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ARTH208-3.4.3-Wassily-Kandinsky.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Kandinsky’s
    contribution to modern art is as significant—if not more so—than
    that of any other artist. In particular, Kandinsky’s use of abstract
    forms was of great importance to Expressionism and 20th-century art
    as a whole. Read this page carefully for references to “abstract”
    and “non-objective” art, examples of Kandinsky’s use of it, and
    reasons for why his art is Expressionist. If you like, take notes on
    why abstraction was so important to his work, and think about the
    impact Kandinsky’s art had both on movements of which he was a part
    (Expressionism, Bauhaus) and subsequent modern movements, such as
    Abstract Expressionism.
