**Unit 7: The Roots of Contemporary Art: Post-Minimalism, Conceptualism,
Performance Art, Feminist Art, and Neo-Expressionism** <span
id="7"></span> 
In this unit, you will learn about the disparate art movements that came
about in the late 1960s and early 1970s and discover how these movements
contributed to what is widely considered the end of modern art and the
emergence of contemporary art. Artists at this time became increasingly
fixated on the notion of art as life, which greatly informed ideas
concerning environmental art, public installation, and social sculpture.
These ideas, in turn, manifested themselves in the forms of Land Art,
Fluxus, Post-Minimalism, and Conceptualism.  
  
 Finally, you will learn about the beginnings of the so-called
postmodern era, which includes the advent of graffiti art and the
“return of the figure” in popular art, as seen in the controversial
Neo-Expressionism movement.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. While reading this
    page, take note of the individual artists associated with
    Post-Minimalism. Additionally, identify, define, and take notes on
    the various forms of Post-Minimalism that were practiced by these
    artists. It’s worth noting that, unlike other modern movements,
    Post-Minimalism was not a cohesive movement of artists all working
    in similar media or under a single ethos, but an unconnected
    assortment of artists practicing multiple types of art, on both a
    small and large scale. When looking at some of the Major Works and
    reading about these artists, consider why this movement is called
    “Post-Minimalism” rather than a continuation of Minimalism.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Richard Serra’s
    art—often considered a unique combination of sculpture, painting,
    and architecture—is experiential in nature. While reading this page
    and looking at his Major Works (with particular emphasis on the work
    Tilted Arc), consider both characteristics of Serra’s work, and how
    they challenged certain conventions in modern art. You may also wish
    to familiarize yourself with the definition of Process Art and think
    about how this style applies to Serra’s work.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Originally trained as a
    painter in the tradition of Abstract Expressionism, Hesse later
    found inspiration in a range of materials that could be considered
    “non-art” materials, much in the tradition of Neo-Dada and
    Minimalism. Read carefully for references to the various materials
    Hesse employed in her practice. Additionally, identify some of the
    key aspects of Hesse’s work. For example, Hesse displayed an
    evolving fascination with creating three-dimensional works of art;
    consider what she was trying to achieve with this practice and how
    she ultimately expanded upon the ideas of Minimalism.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Smithson is well known
    for his Earthworks, a body of complex large-scale works that
    presaged the Land Art movement (sometimes referred to as Earth Art).
    One feature of these works was their site-specificity. While reading
    Smithson’s biography think about what makes Smithson’s work both
    “art” and something utterly different from all art forms that came
    before it. In doing so, consider what happens to Smithson’s earth
    works over time. You may wish to look up recent articles on the
    re-appearance of Smithson’s Spiral Jetty and current plans for its
    preservation.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Conceptual art, or
    Conceptualism, consists of artwork in which far greater emphasis is
    placed on the idea behind the work as opposed to formal or aesthetic
    issues. Conceptual works can focus on the absence of something, or
    may even be completely hidden from view. Cite examples from the
    Major Works section that fit these descriptions.  Do you agree that
    the idea itself can be a piece of art?

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Sol LeWitt is
    considered by many to be the quintessential Conceptual artist, not
    just in the way he executed an idea, but also in the process by
    which his art is created and re-created. In this regard, LeWitt is
    less a traditional visual artist and more an artist-architect. While
    reading about LeWitt’s life and art, consider the role of the
    architect in the construction of a building (or other structure),
    and identify how this role applies to LeWitt and his work. As an
    option, you may consider reading Sol LeWitt’s “Paragraphs on
    Conceptual Art” for additional context.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Beuys had a number of
    fascinating and original ideas about art he routinely and publicly
    expressed, either in writing or through his own artistic practice.
    One particular belief he held was that “every human being is an
    artist.” While reading, take note of any references to Beuys’s
    distinctive beliefs and life experiences, citing specific examples,
    and consider how these informed his art. Additionally, consider
    Beuys’s consistent use of fat and felt in his work and how this
    relates to his conceptual work.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Baldessari’s art is
    famous for its self-effacing, sardonic, and often absurd elements
    and content. One particular concept in Baldessari’s art was his
    removal of artistic authorship from his work, often commissioning
    other people to produce and complete his art (a practice also
    deployed by LeWitt). Consider what it means for a work to have
    artistic authorship. Additionally, look closely at Baldessari’s
    Major Works and note the diversity of media that he has employed,
    including word-based art, a particular brand of Conceptual art for
    which Baldessari is well known. As an option, you should consider
    reading philosopher and critic Roland Barthes’s essay, “The Death of
    the Author.”

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Performance art, much
    like Conceptualism or Post-Minimalism, is defined by its vastness
    and diversity of artistic approaches, on the part of individuals and
    groups alike. Identify the different types of Performance art (i.e.,
    “Happenings”), the artists or artist groups associated with each,
    and consider how this art form is directly tied to other art
    movement such as Dada, action painting, and Process Art. While
    reading this page, you may wish to locate as many references as
    possible to other art forms from which Performance artists derive
    their influence.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Happenings are a form
    of performance art that incorporated elements of chance, crowd
    participation, and improvisation. While reading, note references to
    why these qualities were important to the movement and any parallels
    between Happenings and the Fluxus movement. Additionally, take note
    of the artists associated with Happenings and their individual
    contributions.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Allan Kaprow is
    renowned for his pioneering role in Happenings, both in creating
    them and coining the term for the new art form. Even though Kaprow
    was a performance-based artist as opposed to a fine artist (i.e.,
    painting and sculpture), his art was directly influenced by the
    Abstract Expressionist action painters.  While reading about Kaprow
    and Happenings, note any references that draw a parallel between
    these two seemingly unconnected artistic approaches, as well as
    between Kaprow and Jackson Pollock.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Marina Abramovi? is
    known for performance pieces that are physically and emotionally
    demanding, often requiring a great amount of endurance, and, in at
    least a few instances, caused severe damage to her own body. While
    reading this page, note any references to Abramovi?’s inspiration
    for this body of work, her artistic influences, and her motivation
    for placing herself in dangerous circumstances. Additionally,
    identify Abramovi?’s reason for wanting to record and re-create many
    of her performances (either using herself or other performers), as
    opposed to other performance artists, who prefer the opposite.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Following the demise of
    Abstract Expressionism, the medium of painting grew increasingly out
    of favor in place of avant-garde movements and techniques that
    employed assemblage, concept-based practices, performance, and other
    forms that challenged the boundaries of modern art.
    Neo-Expressionism and the artists associated with it represented a
    kind of “return to basics,” by focusing strictly on two-dimensional
    artwork. Note the number of preceding modern movements that informed
    the Neo-Expressionist artists. Additionally, look at the Major Works
    and identify key differences between this style and those of
    Expressionism and Abstract Expressionism.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Schnabel has claimed
    that with his work he creates an emotional state in which the viewer
    can enter and become engulfed. While reading this page and looking
    at his Major Works, consider again the central ideas of
    Neo-Expressionism, and how Schnabel’s perspective relates to the
    movement’s key objectives. Additionally, while looking at his works,
    consider the specific emotions the artist is expressing and/or
    trying to elicit from the viewer. In your opinion, does he
    succeed?

**7.5.4 Jean-Michel Basquiat** <span id="7.5.4"></span>

    Basquiat”**

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Few artists in history
    have risen to celebrity so fast, and been in such high demand, only
    to die so young, as Jean-Michel Basquiat. Much of Basquiat’s work
    was informed by his experience and proficiency as a graffiti artist
    (a relatively new concept at that time), and by his close friendship
    with Andy Warhol. Look closely at Basquiat’s Major Works and take
    note of how his art changed over the course of his career. Identify
    specific examples of graffiti and Pop Art in his work, and any other
    artistic styles that you can identify.
