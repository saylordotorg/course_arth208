**Unit 5: The Fall of Paris and the Rise of the American Avant-Garde:
Abstract Expressionism** <span id="5"></span> 
In this unit, you will learn about the global shift that took place in
modern art, both leading up to and following World War II, in which New
York replaced Paris as the cultural capital of the world. This unit will
focus on Abstract Expressionism, one of the most celebrated and
important American art movements. You will learn about the American
artists (native-born and naturalized) who constituted this new American
avant-garde, and how they were influenced by key historical events and
political philosophies from the World War II era. Finally, you will read
examples of art criticism from the mid-20th century and become familiar
with the important role criticism and theory played in the continuing
development of modern art.

    Administration proved to be a fundamental training ground for a
    number of artists tied to Early American Modernism and, later on,
    Abstract Expressionism. While reading this page, pay close attention
    to the artists associated with the Federal Art Project and other
    divisions of the WPA. Think about what purpose these artists served
    during this time period (socially, politically, and culturally), and
    how their time with the WPA informed their later work.

    definition of American Regionalism? Furthermore, consider the social
    and political climate of the time and consider why Regionalism was
    significant within this context.  Consider how Benton could go on to
    be the teacher of the Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Hofmann was a major
    twentieth-century artist for various reasons, including his vital
    role as an educator and his experience training and producing art
    alongside a number of European modern masters. While reading this
    page, pay close attention to Hofmann’s “Push and Pull” theory, along
    with some of his other art theories, and consider the reasons that
    Hofmann’s influence was felt so widely by the Abstract
    Expressionists.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. In this page, there are
    multiple references to “abstract” art or “abstraction.” Pay close
    attention to these references, look carefully at Mondrian’s Major
    Works, and consider why the artist’s works are a good example of
    pure abstraction.  Also, there are many paths artists took to arrive
    at abstraction.  Consider how Mondrian started creating abstract
    works.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Although it is
    commonplace today, in 1929, when MoMA was founded, the concept of a
    museum devoted to modern, or new, art was a highly unusual one.
    Consider why this was such an extraordinary idea. Furthermore, look
    for references in this page to the museum’s founding principles, the
    reasons for MoMA’s success, and, finally, cases when the museum
    failed to respond to key trends in modern art. As an option, you may

    references to the other movements, artists, and philosophies that
    directly influenced Abstract Expressionist artists, and point to
    specific examples.  
        
     Additionally, consider the reasons for why Abstract Expressionism
    was a uniquely American movement, and the ways in which it
    transformed the landscape of modern art. As an option, you may wish
    to visit and review events from The Art Story Foundation’s
    Timelines: “Abstract Expressionism Movement Timeline”.  Finally,

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Jackson Pollock is best
    known for his drip, or spatter, paintings - an unusual technique
    that redefined the modern conception of abstraction. While reading
    this page, look closely for references to Pollock’s drip technique.
    Consider why it garnered so much critical attention during this
    time. Additionally, look closely for references to Pollock’s ties to
    the critic Clement Greenberg, one of the most important
    artist-critic relationships in all of art history. Take notes on
    Greenberg’s critical opinion of Pollock’s work.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Rothko’s work is among
    the most recognizable in all of modern art, and certainly amongst
    the Abstract Expressionists. Read carefully and take notes on
    Rothko’s painting style, his “multi-forms,” and, in particular, his
    personal philosophy and beliefs. Ask yourself what Rothko was trying
    to achieve through his art. For additional clarity on his
    philosophy, look to the Writings and Ideas section of this page.
    Additionally, consider that in life Rothko disliked being called an
    “abstractionist.” What can you infer from your reading of this page
    that would help explain why this would be so?

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. When examining the
    important art critics of the 20th century, it is perhaps easy to
    overlook anyone who wasn’t Greenberg or Rosenberg. However, the
    critical writing of Leo Steinberg had a lasting impact on people’s
    understanding and appreciation of modern art forms. While reading
    this page, look for references to Steinberg’s “Other Criteria.” What
    does Steinberg mean by “Other Criteria,” and how did he apply this
    idea to artists like Picasso, de Kooning, and Jasper Johns?

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Helen Frankenthaler was
    a pioneer of Color Field painting. Identify the definition of Color
    Field painting, consider how Frankenthaler’s work is a key exemplar
    of this style, and, finally, think about how Frankenthaler’s art is
    both similar to and different from the work of the first generation
    of Abstract Expressionists. As an option, you should consider
    reading “Color Field Painting”on The Art Story Foundation’s
    Movements page.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Noland’s art represents
    a key example of the style known as Post-Painterly Abstraction, a
    term coined by ClementGreenberg. Noland employed a number of motifs
    in his art, using instantly recognizable forms and shapes that
    became his signature. Identify these different motifs and consider
    what Noland was attempting to achieve with such paintings. Would you
    regard Noland’s art as abstract? Finally, consider which
    characteristics of Noland’s art make it modern. As an option, you
    might wish to read The Art Story Foundation’s Movements page,
    “Post-Painterly Abstraction.”

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. In addition to Color
    Field painting, Kelly’s art also falls into the category of
    Hard-Edge painting. Identify the definition of Hard-Edge painting,
    and consider how Kelly’s work is a key example of this technique. In
    addition, look for descriptions of Kelly’s use and application of
    color (“bold,” “solid,” “monochromatic,” etc.), and how these
    elements apply to both Color Field and Hard-Edge painting. And like
    the art of his contemporaries (i.e., Frankenthaler and Noland),
    consider whether Kelly’s art is truly abstract. Finally, consider
    Kelly’s use of shaped canvases, the sculptural elements of his work,
    and how his art represented a new phase in the development of
    abstract modern art.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Diebenkorn and his art
    were directly influenced by his geographical surroundings, more so
    than many of his modern art predecessors and certainly more so than
    the leading first-generation Abstract Expressionists. While reading
    this page, look for references to the various locales Diebenkorn
    inhabited throughout his career and cite examples, using his Major
    Works as reference material, of how particular artworks were
    informed by these changes in geography.
