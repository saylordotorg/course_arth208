**Unit 4: The Manifesto Era: Suprematism, Constructivism, Dada and
Surrealism** <span id="4"></span> 
In this unit, you will study Suprematism, Constructivism, Dada, and
Surrealism: art movements of the early 20th century that attempted to
shift perspectives on art and its place in society. For example, with
the emergence of Surrealism in the 1920s, key artists such as André
Breton and Max Ernst portrayed dream-like scenes from the unconscious,
depicting a realistic world inhabited entirely by unreal entities. The
depiction of the life of the mind was a major contribution to the
history of art.  
  
 In this unit, you will become familiar with the notion of art as
manifesto: you will explore the ways in which artists from this era set
forth their goals through declarative written statements and used art as
a vehicle for social and/or political change, and will examine the
processes by which “non-art” objects and ideas infiltrated the realm of
fine art. You will also learn about the Bauhaus, an influential school
for modern artists in training, and will discover how this institution
and its instructors promoted radical ideas about artistic production
while bridging the worlds of art, design, and industry.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. While reading this
    page, you will notice a passage that begins with “Suprematist
    painting abandoned realism.” Think about what this means, and what
    the Suprematist artists (chiefly Kazimir Malevich) were trying to
    achieve with their art by abandoning realism. Finally, think about
    what visual characteristics Suprematist art possesses that would
    suggest such an abandonment of realism. Finally, consider the root
    of the name “Suprematism,” and identify reasons for why the
    Suprematist artists considered their art supreme.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Malevich used a number
    of different and distinctive motifs throughout his work, most
    notably, geometric shapes such as circles, triangles, and squares,
    the last of which comprise his most famous paintings. Through his
    use of an abstract visual language dominated by such elements,
    Malevich truly believed he was making a revolutionary contribution
    not only to the development of art but also society as well.
    Considering Malevich’s native country, the time period in which he
    lived, and his fellow artists, think about why Malevich believed his
    art was so groundbreaking.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. El Lissitzky’s work was
    very important to the Suprematist and Constructivist movements.
    However, there are key differences in both artistic style and
    content between Lissitzky’s art and that of his one-time mentor,
    Kazimir Malevich. After reading about Lissitzky, you may wish to
    briefly revisit the Malevich page and identify some of those key
    differences. Finally, identify some of the artist’s personal traits
    and beliefs that likely contributed to his art.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. As with Suprematism,
    consider the root of the name “Constructivism.” The Constructivist
    artists, many of whom were also associated with Suprematism,
    established this movement as a means to create something utterly new
    and revolutionary. Read this page closely for references to the
    Constructivist ideology and to what the Constructivists were
    attempting to achieve. Additionally, identify the term
    “Productivism,” its definition, and consider the importance of this
    movement within the larger Constructivist movement.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Rodchenko is a key
    example of an artist whose work and politics were virtually
    interchangeable. While reading this page, pay close attention to
    content that refers to the Russian Revolution, the political beliefs
    associated with it, and Rodchenko’s relationship to the event. What
    were Rodchenko’s artistic achievements, and were they as effective
    as he hoped they would be?

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Dada was truly
    avant-garde for its concern with the deconstruction of both standard
    forms and conventional ideas in art. While reading this page,
    identify some of the forms and ideas the Dada artists were out to
    deconstruct, or outright nullify. As an option, you may wish to read
    excerpts from Tristan Tzara’s "Dada's Manifesto" to get a better
    idea of the tenets of this iconoclastic and highly influential
    movement.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Duchamp’s greatest
    contribution to modern art was quite possibly the “Readymade.” Read
    carefully for the definition of this art form and identify examples
    of it in Duchamp’s Major Works. Consider why the Readymade is such a
    unique and important contribution to modern art. Finally, identify
    some of the different modern art movements that were directly
    influenced by Duchamp’s ideas.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Unlike most modern
    artists, Picabia frequently shifted between abstraction and
    figuration, showing preference for neither. Read this page carefully
    and look for references to this pattern throughout his work. In
    particular, identify some of the abstract and figurative qualities
    in Picabia’s work, and consider the artist’s relationship to the
    central concepts of the Dada movement.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Man Ray’s most
    significant contribution to the avant-garde was (arguably) his work
    in photography. Pay particularly close attention to the page’s
    Mature Period and Late Years sections in the biography and identify
    the artist’s specific discoveries in this medium. Think about how
    these new developments in photography are connected to Dada; feel
    free to revisit the readings from subunit 4.3.1 when considering
    these connections.

    until 1933, the Bauhaus was critical for pre-war European artists
    and remains one of the most significant modern art movements of the
    early twentieth century. What’s more, many of the era’s most
    celebrated architects trained and taught at the school, resulting in
    an architectural style known simply as “Bauhaus” that is still
    practiced to this day. Beyond architecture, what was so unique in
    the founding ethos of the school?

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. While reading, you will
    note that Albers was among the first artists to experiment with
    “geometric abstraction.” Read this page carefully and look at his
    Major Works, and consider what Albers was trying to achieve with
    this particular style, and how the artist’s experimental and
    distinctively modern art is emblematic of the Bauhaus’s teachings.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. You will note in
    reading this page that many parallels have been made between Klee’s
    art and musical composition. Read carefully for such references and
    identify ways in which Klee’s art was both distinctly modern and
    idiosyncratic, defying categorization into any one particular
    movement or school. What did he take away from his connection to the

    page, pay particularly close attention to the “Key Ideas” section.
    For each of these points, identify one or more of Magritte’s Major
    Works that fit a description from the Key Ideas. Additionally, look
    closely at Magritte’s Late Period and consider how the artist’s work
    and approach to art changed during this time period.  Keep in mind
    the ideas of Duchamp and Breton as you read about Magritte’s
    contribution to modern art.

    more recognizable and controversial than Salvador Dalí, whose art

    imagery. Read this page carefully and identify key points that
    reference Dalí’s attempted goals in painting this way. Finally,
    think about examples of artists that were influenced by Dalí’s art
    and ideas.

    meaning of biomorphism, and explain specifically how the artist
    applied such forms within his work.
