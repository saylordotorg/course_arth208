Course Syllabus for "ARTH208: Modern Art"
-----------------------------------------

In this course, you will study the various artistic movements that
comprise 19th- and 20th-century modern art. You will examine several
dozen artists, all of whom helped define their respective artistic
styles and eras through their innovative approaches to representation,
artistic space, and the role of the artist in society. Each unit will
cover a significant period in the history of modern art and explore the
ways in which both the principal figures from each period and the
corresponding movements challenged the limits of art through the
incorporation of modern life, as each artist addresses the political,
philosophical, and personal implications of “modernity” and how it
relates to the production of artwork. This course will begin with a
brief review of the artists and movements that immediately preceded
French Impressionism and will then take an in-depth look at the key
artists and characteristics of Impressionism, widely considered the
first “modern” art movement. You will then spend time reading about and
examining various other major movements including Post-Impressionism,
Art Nouveau, Expressionism, Cubism, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism,
and Pop Art, among others. As part of our study of these movements and
the artists associated with them, you will be expected to learn a number
of artistic terms and ideas, along with the people and institutions that
were influential in the development of modern art. As an example, you
will be able to look at Pablo Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’ Avignon and
explain why this can be considered the first Cubist artwork, and what
makes it one of the greatest achievements in modern art. You will view
Jackson Pollock’s Abstract Expressionist drip paintings and be able to
elaborate on what makes these works a revolutionary achievement that
opened up artistic possibilities for many future artists.  These
examples and many others involving artists, their work, media, and
styles will be explored in great detail throughout this course.
