**Unit 2: Turn of the Century Art: Post-Impressionism, Symbolism and Art
Nouveau** <span id="2"></span> 
In this unit, you will learn about the European art movements that
emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the immediate
aftermath of Impressionism. Perhaps most notable among these are
Post-Impressionism, whose artists reacted against Impressionism’s focus
on the external, observed world and sought to replace Impressionism as
the leading avant-garde movement. You will look at seminal artworks by
the Post-Impressionists and other important modern masters, including
the Symbolists and Art Nouveau artists. You will also learn about the
Bauhaus, an influential school for modern artists-in-training, and will
discover how this institution and its instructors promoted radical ideas
about artistic production while bridging the worlds of art, design, and
industry.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Unlike Impressionism,
    Post-Impressionism was not a cohesive and unified movement of
    artists. While reading this page, identify and take notes on the
    many visual characteristics that made the works of artists like
    Gauguin, van Gogh, Seurat, and Cézanne different from those of the
    key Impressionists. Most importantly, notice how each of these
    artists paved the road to future modern art advancement.

    Divisionism and Pointillism. Familiarize yourself with these terms,
    take notes on the characteristics of the two respective painting
    styles, and look to Seurat’s Major Works for examples of each.

    most distinctive and recognizable painting styles of any modern
    artist. While reading, look for written examples that explain what

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. Gauguin has been called
    a “primitive” artist as well as one of the first Symbolists. While
    reading, pay close attention to language that explains his artistic
    approach, and identify characteristics in his paintings (painting
    style and subject matter) that fit these definitions.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. You may note from
    looking at Cézanne’s body of work that the artist did not mature as
    a painter until late in life. While reading this page, pay close
    attention to how Cézanne’s visual style changes and becomes more
    abstract over time. As an option, you may want to read The Art
    Story’s [“Abstract vs. Figurative
    Art”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/The-Art-Story_-Comparison_-Abstract-vs.-Figurative-Art.pdf)(PDF)
    page to familiarize yourself with the definitions of each. Finally,
    consider why Cézanne has been called the “grandfather of Cubism” and
    what was his achievement.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. You will note that
    among the Symbolist artists, Rodin’s art is the most classical in
    style and appearance, not “modern”.  Look closely at Rodin’s Major
    Works, and the page’s “Key Ideas” section, and consider what
    characterizes a classical work of art. Finally, identify ways in
    which Rodin’s work appears classical, but is in fact modern and
    revolutionary.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. What is Munch
    expressing with works like The Scream, through both his painting
    style and his subject matter? Furthermore, Munch’s Symbolist
    paintings (i.e., The Sick Child, The Scream) have been identified as
    key predecessors to the German Expressionist movement. While reading
    this page, you may want to visit the ["Expressionism"
    movement](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ARTH208-3.4.1-Expressionism.pdf)

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read the linked page in full. You will note in this
    reading that Chagall is one of the most celebrated of all Symbolist
    painters. His distinctive talent for and use of color, space, and
    form is widely regarded as an outstanding achievement in modern art.
    Look closely at Chagall’s style and subject matter, consider taking
    notes on his personal history, and try to identify exactly what is
    symbolized in Chagall’s art.

     Instructions: Read the linked page in full.  Consider the reason
    for this new style of art to emerge at this point in history, and
    keep in mind the art that was created at the time prior to this
    movement.  
        
     Additionally, you will note that the style known as Art Nouveau was
    not a unified movement, but a collection of disparate movements
    across Europe that went by several different names. You may wish to
    take notes while reading, and identify the different approaches
    artists took to produce works that fall within this combined
    movement.

    to take notes on these key events.
